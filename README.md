# LocalStack running inside GitHub Actions

Having come from a place of using containers with the desired language version preinstalled to run my tests - this example happens to use Ruby but that's just because I like writing things in Ruby, you should use whatever works best for the code _you_ need to write - in Docker Compose (and then GitHub Actions), I was initially a bit confused to find that the GitHub Packages weren't working the way I'd hoped.

I span up a GitHub Actions version of the standard config that was already in place when I joined the project, tried to add LocalStack and â€¦ was met with either "unable to locate executable" or - even more depressing - a screenful of GLIBC version errors.

Fortunately the solution's a simple one. If you don't have control over the image - to allow you to upgrade to a newer OS version or to bake in the version of GNU libc that's demanded by the installer - simply, remove the `container:` (and `image`, if using) line(s) from your workflow file and install what you need directly into the OS specified by `runs-on:` instead, per https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container#example-running-a-job-within-a-container

Problem solved!

(Yes, you probably could figure out a way to install packages within your workflow but this will add more time - and therefore more cost - to your job steps (for each run!) compared with using a GitHub Package - so that's not an ideal solution.)

You can jump straight into [the example workflow file here](.github/workflows/localstack.workflow.yaml) if you don't want to wade through my example code.

Don't copy my test code though - it doesn't use AWS mocks for files properly because I'm mostly using this to prove that LocalStack is working inside GitHub Actions - from the Ruby code, rather than calling `awslocal` directly - using real files. The demo class is called `BadExample` for a reason!

## Caching

To speed things up, you can also add caching to your GitHub Actions for longer running processes like installing you Ruby gems so that it doesn't happen every time you run your workflow, even when you haven't made any changes to your Gemfile. (Note that this also required some changes to the workflow so it knows to use the cache.)

The first time around it's slower as it's setting up the cache for the first time, then each subsequent run is faster(until there's an edit that changes the cache).

With a free account, you can currently store up to 500 MB and up to 1 GB with a Pro account [up to date information can be found here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes)
